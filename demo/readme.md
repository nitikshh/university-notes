# üßæ**Tank Circuit**: *Working, Diagram, and Applications*

## 1. Introduction

In the world of electronics, circuits capable of generating or selecting specific frequencies are of great importance. Among them, the **Tank Circuit**, also known as an **LC Circuit**, **Resonant Circuit**, or **Tuned Circuit**, plays a fundamental role in communication systems, signal processing, and oscillation generation.
A tank circuit consists of two key passive components ‚Äî a **capacitor (C)** and an **inductor (L)** ‚Äî connected either in series or in parallel. Together, they can store electrical and magnetic energy and exchange it back and forth, forming a natural oscillator at a particular frequency known as the **resonant frequency**.

This resonant behavior makes the tank circuit a vital component in devices such as **radios, filters, transmitters, and receivers**, where frequency tuning and signal selection are essential.

## 2. Historical Background

The discovery of oscillatory electrical behavior dates back to **1827**, when **Felix Savary** observed electromagnetic oscillations while experimenting with a **Leyden jar** (a primitive capacitor). His work laid the foundation for the understanding of oscillating electric and magnetic fields.
Later, scientists like **Guglielmo Marconi** used these principles to develop **radio communication systems**, where LC circuits played a critical role in tuning and signal transmission.

## 3. Definition of a Tank Circuit

A **Tank Circuit** is defined as:

> _An electrical circuit consisting of a capacitor (C) connected to an inductor (L) that stores and transfers energy between the capacitor‚Äôs electric field and the inductor‚Äôs magnetic field at a specific resonant frequency._

It is called a **‚Äútank‚Äù** circuit because it ‚Äústores‚Äù electrical energy temporarily, similar to how a water tank stores water. When the capacitor is charged, it holds energy in its electric field; when discharged through the inductor, energy shifts to the magnetic field ‚Äî and this back-and-forth exchange creates oscillations.

## 4. Construction and Circuit Diagram

A basic tank circuit can be constructed using:

- **Inductor (L)** ‚Äì made of a coil of conducting wire (usually copper) that stores energy in a magnetic field.
- **Capacitor (C)** ‚Äì a device with two conductive plates separated by an insulator, storing energy in an electric field.
- **Connecting wires** ‚Äì to connect the two components either in **series** or **parallel**.

### (a) Parallel LC Tank Circuit

In a **parallel configuration**, the inductor and capacitor are connected across the same voltage source. It behaves as a **resonant circuit** that can store energy efficiently and allows current oscillation between the two components.

## 5. Principle of Operation

The **working principle** of a tank circuit is based on **resonance** ‚Äî the natural tendency of the system to oscillate at a particular frequency.

1. When the **capacitor** is charged and then allowed to discharge through the **inductor**, current flows through the coil.
2. This flow of current generates a **magnetic field** around the inductor, which stores energy.
3. As the capacitor discharges fully, the magnetic field around the inductor begins to **collapse**, inducing an EMF (electromotive force) in the opposite direction.
4. This EMF **recharges the capacitor** but with **opposite polarity**, and the process repeats.
5. Thus, energy oscillates back and forth between the capacitor‚Äôs electric field and the inductor‚Äôs magnetic field.

This continuous transfer of energy results in **oscillating current and voltage** ‚Äî forming an **LC oscillator**.

## 6. Mathematical Expression and Resonant Frequency

The **resonant frequency (f)** of the tank circuit is the frequency at which the energy exchange between L and C occurs most efficiently.

The angular frequency (œâ) and linear frequency (f) are given by:

Where:

- ( L ) = Inductance (Henrys)
- ( C ) = Capacitance (Farads)
- ( f ) = Resonant Frequency (Hertz)

At this frequency:

- The **inductive reactance (XL)** and **capacitive reactance (XC)** are equal in magnitude but opposite in phase.
- Therefore, ( XL = XC )
- The circuit impedance is purely resistive, allowing maximum current to flow (in series LC) or maximum voltage (in parallel LC).

## 7. Energy Exchange and Damping

In an ideal LC circuit, energy exchange continues indefinitely. However, in real systems, resistance in wires and components causes **energy loss**, leading to **damped oscillations**.

To maintain continuous oscillations, **positive feedback** is provided using amplifying components like **transistors or op-amps**, forming an **LC Oscillator Circuit**.

## 8. Types of Tank Circuits

Tank circuits are classified based on how the inductor (L) and capacitor (C) are connected within the circuit. The two primary types are **series** and **parallel** tank circuits, each exhibiting distinct electrical characteristics and applications.

### (a) Series Resonant Circuit

In a **series resonant circuit**, the inductor and capacitor are connected end-to-end, forming a single path for current flow.

#### Key Features:
- **Minimum Impedance at Resonance:** At the resonant frequency, the inductive reactance (XL) and capacitive reactance (XC) are equal in magnitude but opposite in phase, effectively canceling each other out. The circuit‚Äôs total impedance drops to its minimum value, limited only by any resistance present.
- **Maximum Current Flow:** Due to the low impedance at resonance, the circuit allows maximum current to flow through it.
- **Voltage Magnification:** The voltages across the inductor and capacitor can be much higher than the applied voltage, but they are 180¬∞ out of phase and cancel each other in the total circuit.
- **Frequency Selectivity:** The circuit strongly responds to signals at its resonant frequency, making it useful for selecting or filtering out specific frequencies.

#### Applications:
- **Filters:** Used in band-pass and band-stop filters to allow or block certain frequencies.
- **Signal Selection:** Employed in radio receivers and transmitters to select desired frequency channels.
- **Impedance Matching:** Used in RF circuits to match impedances for maximum power transfer.

---

### (b) Parallel Resonant Circuit

In a **parallel resonant circuit** (also called a parallel LC or tank circuit), the inductor and capacitor are connected across the same two nodes, sharing the same voltage.

#### Key Features:
- **Maximum Impedance at Resonance:** At the resonant frequency, the current through the inductor and capacitor are equal and opposite, resulting in minimal net current from the source. The circuit presents a very high impedance to the resonant frequency.
- **Minimum Current Draw:** The source supplies very little current at resonance, as most of the current circulates between the inductor and capacitor.
- **Voltage Magnification:** The voltage across the LC combination can be much higher than the supply voltage due to resonance.
- **Energy Storage:** The circuit efficiently stores and exchanges energy between the magnetic field of the inductor and the electric field of the capacitor.

#### Applications:
- **Oscillators:** Forms the frequency-determining element in LC oscillators (e.g., Colpitts, Hartley).
- **Tuned Amplifiers:** Used in RF amplifiers to amplify signals at a specific frequency.
- **Frequency Selection:** Essential in radio tuning circuits to select the desired station or frequency.

## 9. Working Example (Step-by-Step)

Let‚Äôs consider a **parallel LC circuit** connected to a DC power source.

1. **Charging phase:** The capacitor charges up to the supply voltage.
2. **Discharge phase:** The capacitor discharges through the inductor, building a magnetic field.
3. **Recharging phase:** When the magnetic field collapses, it recharges the capacitor in reverse polarity.
4. **Oscillation:** The capacitor continues charging and discharging alternately, creating an oscillating current and voltage.

This cycle repeats as long as energy is supplied, producing **sine wave oscillations** at the resonant frequency.

## 10. Importance of Resonance

Resonance allows the circuit to **select or amplify** signals of a particular frequency while rejecting others.
For example, in radio receivers:

- Each station transmits at a unique frequency.
- The LC circuit is tuned (by adjusting L or C) to that frequency.
- Only the desired signal resonates, while others are filtered out.
