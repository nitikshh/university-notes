# 📘 Unit 1 – Computer Systems (Detailed Notes)

---

## 1. **Basic Structure of a Computer**

A computer is an **electronic system** that takes **raw data (input)**, processes it, and produces **meaningful information (output)**.

This entire process depends on two major components:

- **Hardware** – The physical parts you can touch.
- **Software** – The instructions/programs that make hardware work.

---

### 🔹 1.1 Hardware

Hardware refers to the **tangible components** of a computer system.
It can be divided into several categories:

#### (i) **Input Devices**

- Devices through which we give **instructions or data** to the computer.
- Convert human actions into **machine-readable signals**.

👉 Examples:

- **Keyboard** – Typing numbers, letters, commands.
- **Mouse** – Pointing, selecting, dragging.
- **Scanner** – Converting paper documents → digital form.
- **Microphone** – Capturing voice input.

---

#### (ii) **Output Devices**

- Devices through which the computer **communicates back** with us.
- Converts processed data into a form humans can understand.

👉 Examples:

- **Monitor** – Displays visuals/text (soft copy).
- **Printer** – Produces printed documents (hard copy).
- **Speakers** – Output in the form of sound.

---

#### (iii) **Storage Devices**

- Devices that **store data & programs** temporarily or permanently.
- Two categories:

  - **Primary storage** (RAM, Cache, ROM) – fast, CPU-accessible.
  - **Secondary storage** (HDD, SSD, USB) – larger, permanent.

👉 Example:

- When editing a Word file → data is first in **RAM**.
- Once you save → it goes to **HDD/SSD**.

---

#### (iv) **Central Processing Unit (CPU)**

- Called the **“brain of the computer.”**
- Responsible for all calculations and decision-making.
- Contains:

  - **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):** Performs math (addition, subtraction) and logic (>, <, =) operations.
  - **Control Unit (CU):** Directs data flow between memory, input/output, and ALU.
  - **Registers & Cache:** Ultra-fast memory for temporary storage.

👉 Example:
When you calculate `45 + 23` in Calculator app:

- ALU does the addition.
- CU manages the steps.
- Result stored briefly in registers, then shown on monitor.

---

#### (v) **Motherboard**

- The **main circuit board** of the computer.
- Connects all hardware components together (CPU, memory, storage, input/output).
- Uses **buses** (communication lines) to transfer data.

👉 Analogy: Like a **city’s road network**, connecting all important places.

---

#### (vi) **Other Peripherals**

- **Network cards** (LAN/WiFi) – enable internet.
- **Graphic cards (GPU)** – handle images, gaming, video editing.
- **Power Supply Unit (PSU)** – provides electricity to all parts.

---

### 🔹 1.2 Software

Software = **Programs & instructions** that control hardware and help users interact with the computer.

#### Types of Software:

1. **System Software**

   - Manages hardware & provides a platform for other software.
   - Examples:

     - **Operating System (OS):** Windows, Linux, macOS.
     - **Utility Programs:** Antivirus, Disk cleanup, File compression tools.

2. **Application Software**

   - Programs that perform specific user tasks.
   - Examples:

     - MS Word, Excel (productivity).
     - Photoshop (design).
     - Chrome, Firefox (browsers).
     - Games, Media players.

3. **Programming Software**

   - Tools used by developers to write code.
   - Examples: Compilers, IDEs (Eclipse, VS Code, PyCharm).

---

### 🔹 1.3 Interaction Between Hardware and Software

- Hardware **cannot work alone** without software.
- Software **cannot run** without hardware.
- They have a **symbiotic relationship**.

👉 Example (Typing a letter in MS Word):

1. You press a key on **keyboard (hardware)**.
2. **Operating System (software)** processes keystroke.
3. MS Word (application software) displays the character.
4. **Monitor (hardware)** shows it visually.

---

### 🔹 1.4 Example Analogy

Think of a **human body**:

- **Hardware** = Organs (brain, hands, eyes).
- **Software** = Thoughts & instructions telling organs what to do.
- Without **organs**, thoughts are useless. Without **thoughts**, organs don’t know what to do.

---

✅ **Summary of Basic Structure:**

- Computer = **Hardware + Software**.
- Hardware → Input, Output, Storage, CPU, Motherboard.
- Software → System, Application, Programming.
- Both are interdependent.

Got it 👍 Since this is a **basic topic**, I’ll keep it **simple, clear, and easy to understand** without going too deep into technicalities.

---

## 2. **Computer Associated Peripherals**

Peripherals are the **extra devices** connected to a computer that allow us to **interact with it**.
They are mainly of two types: **Input devices** and **Output devices**.

---

### (a) **Input Devices**

- Input devices are like the **senses of a computer**.
- They allow users to give **data and instructions** to the computer.
- These devices convert our actions into **digital signals** that the CPU can understand.

👉 **Examples:**

- **Keyboard** – Used to type letters, numbers, and commands.
- **Mouse** – Used to move the cursor, click, and select items.
- **Scanner** – Converts paper documents or photos into digital form.
- **Microphone** – Records our voice and converts it into digital sound.

📌 **Example in real life:**
When you play a game, pressing keys on the **keyboard** or moving the **mouse** sends input to the CPU, which processes it and shows movement in the game.

---

### (b) **Output Devices**

- Output devices are how the computer **shows the result** of the processing back to us.
- They take the **digital signals** from the CPU and convert them into a form we can **see, hear, or touch**.

👉 **Examples:**

- **Monitor (Screen)** – Displays text, images, and videos.
- **Printer** – Produces a printed copy of your document (hard copy).
- **Speakers / Headphones** – Give sound output like music, voice, or alerts.

📌 **Example in real life:**
When you type in MS Word (input from keyboard), the letters appear on the **monitor** (output), and if you print the file, the **printer** gives you a paper copy.

---

### 🔗 **Connection Between Input and Output**

- **Input → Processing (CPU) → Output**
- Example:

  1. You **press keys** on the keyboard (input).
  2. CPU **processes the instruction**.
  3. Result is shown on the **monitor** (output).

---

✅ **Summary:**

- Input devices = **Give data to the computer**.
- Output devices = **Show results from the computer**.
- Both are necessary for communication between humans and computers.

---

## 3. **Central Processing Unit (CPU)**

- The **CPU** is called the **“Brain of the Computer”** because it controls everything happening inside a computer.
- It **executes instructions**, **does calculations**, and **manages data flow** between all parts of the system.

---

### 🔹 Main Components of CPU

1. **Control Unit (CU)**

   - Works like a **traffic controller**.
   - Directs how data moves between memory, input devices, output devices, and the ALU.
   - Makes sure every instruction runs in the correct order.

   👉 Example:
   If you press the “Print” button, CU tells the CPU to send the document from memory to the printer.

---

2. **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)**

   - The **calculator of the CPU**.
   - Performs **arithmetic operations** (add, subtract, multiply, divide).
   - Performs **logical operations** (compare numbers: greater, smaller, equal).

   👉 Example:
   If you calculate `2 + 3` in Calculator, the ALU adds them and gives the result `5`.

---

3. **Registers & Cache Memory**

   - **Registers** are **tiny storage spaces** inside the CPU. They hold data temporarily while instructions are being executed.
   - **Cache memory** is **small, very fast memory** close to the CPU. It stores frequently used data so the CPU doesn’t waste time fetching it from main RAM.

   👉 Example:
   When you repeatedly press **Ctrl+Z (Undo)** in Word, cache memory helps the CPU recall recent actions instantly.

---

### 🔹 How CPU Works (Simple Flow)

1. **Fetch** → CPU gets instruction from memory (like “Add 2 + 3”).
2. **Decode** → CU understands what needs to be done.
3. **Execute** → ALU performs the calculation or logic.
4. **Store/Output** → Result is stored in registers or shown to user.

👉 Example:
Typing `2 + 3` in Calculator → CPU fetches the numbers, ALU adds them, CU directs the process, and the **screen shows 5**.

---

✅ **Summary:**

- CPU = Brain of the computer.
- **CU** = Controls everything.
- **ALU** = Calculates & compares.
- **Registers & Cache** = Superfast temporary storage.
- Without CPU, no operation in a computer is possible.

---

## 4. **Motherboard**

- The **motherboard** is the **main circuit board** of a computer.
- It is called the **backbone** because all other parts (CPU, memory, storage, input/output devices) are connected to it.
- It makes sure every part of the computer can **communicate and work together**.

---

### 🔹 Key Features of a Motherboard

1. **Holds the CPU** – The CPU is placed in a special slot (called the processor socket).
2. **Holds Memory (RAM/ROM)** – RAM sticks are connected to memory slots on the motherboard.
3. **Connects Storage Devices** – Hard disks (HDD), SSDs, and optical drives are connected through ports (like SATA, NVMe).
4. **Expansion Slots** – Extra slots where you can add cards such as:

   - Graphics Card (GPU)
   - Sound Card
   - Network Card

5. **Power Supply Distribution** – Distributes power from the PSU to all components.
6. **Buses (Communication lines)** – Act like “roads” that carry data between CPU, memory, and other parts.

---

### 🔹 Example / Analogy

Think of a **city**:

- **CPU** = City Hall (brain).
- **Memory** = Libraries (temporary and permanent storage).
- **Storage** = Warehouses (long-term data).
- **Expansion Slots** = New buildings (extra functions).
- **Motherboard** = Road network that connects everything together.

---

✅ **Summary:**

- Motherboard is the **foundation** of a computer system.
- It connects CPU, memory, storage, and other devices.
- Without it, the parts cannot communicate or function as one system.

---

## 5. **🧠 Memory**

### 1. **What is Memory?**

- Memory is the **storage space in a computer** where data, instructions, and results are kept for use during processing and after.
- The CPU interacts with memory continuously for:

  1. **Fetching instructions**
  2. **Storing temporary data**
  3. **Saving permanent results**

👉 Think of memory as a **workspace + storage unit** for the computer.

---

### 2. **Classification of Memory**

Memory is broadly divided into two categories:

#### (A) **Primary Memory (Main Memory)**

- **Directly accessed by the CPU**.
- **Fast but limited in size**.
- **Volatile** (most types lose data when power is off).

#### (i) **RAM (Random Access Memory)**

- Temporary, **read/write memory**.
- Stores:

  - Programs currently running.
  - Data being processed by CPU.

- **Volatile** → Data disappears when computer is shut down.

**Types of RAM:**

1. **SRAM (Static RAM)**

   - Stores data in flip-flop circuits.
   - **Very fast, expensive, consumes more power**.
   - Does **not need refreshing**.

   - After writing data, it **cannot be erased**.
   - Example: Used in older hardware where firmware was burned once.

3. **EPROM (Erasable Programmable ROM)**

   - Data can be **erased using ultraviolet (UV) light**.
   - Chip can then be reprogrammed.
   - Example: Older gaming cartridges.

4. **EEPROM (Electrically Erasable PROM)**

   - Data can be **erased electrically** (no need for UV light).
   - Data can be rewritten many times.
   - Example: Used in microcontrollers.

5. **Flash Memory**

   - A modern type of EEPROM.
   - Faster erase/write cycles.
   - Example: USB drives, SSDs, memory cards.

---

#### (iii) **Cache Memory**

- Very fast, small-sized memory located **between CPU and RAM**.
- Stores frequently used instructions/data to reduce CPU waiting time.
- Levels:

  - **L1 Cache** → Inside CPU core (fastest, smallest).
  - **L2 Cache** → Between CPU and RAM.
  - **L3 Cache** → Shared among cores in multi-core CPUs.

👉 Example: When you repeatedly press **Undo (Ctrl+Z)** in Word, cache memory helps recall recent actions quickly.

---

#### (iv) **Registers**

- Smallest and fastest memory inside CPU.
- Hold data temporarily while instructions are being executed.
- Example: Program Counter (stores next instruction address).

---

### (B) **Secondary Memory**

- Used for **long-term storage**.
- **Not directly accessed by CPU** → Data first copied to RAM, then used.
- **Non-volatile** → Retains data without power.
- Larger in size, slower compared to primary memory.

#### (i) **Magnetic Disks**

- Example: **Hard Disk Drive (HDD)**.
- Components:

  1. **Platters** – Circular disks storing data.
  2. **Tracks** – Concentric circles on platters.
  3. **Sectors** – Subdivisions of tracks.
  4. **Read/Write Head** – Reads/writes data.
  5. **Spindle + Actuator Arm** – Rotate and position heads.

👉 Example: Saving a movie on your PC → stored permanently on HDD.

#### (ii) **Solid State Drives (SSD)**

- Stores data in **NAND Flash chips**.
- **No moving parts → Faster, more reliable**.
- Costlier per GB than HDD.
- Used in modern laptops, gaming PCs.

👉 Example: PC booting faster with SSD.

#### (iii) **Optical Disks**

Great 👍 Let’s now do a **deep dive into RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks)** — covering **all RAID levels, their working, diagrams (conceptual), advantages/disadvantages, and real-world use cases**.

---

# 💾 RAID (Redundant Array of Independent/Inexpensive Disks)

---

## 1. **What is RAID?**

* RAID is a method of **combining multiple physical hard drives (HDD/SSD)** into a single logical unit for:

  1. **Performance improvement**
  2. **Data redundancy (safety from failures)**
  3. **Fault tolerance (system keeps working even if a drive fails)**

👉 Analogy:
Think of RAID like **writing notes**:

* You can split notes among friends (striping),
* Or keep multiple identical copies (mirroring),
* Or write backup codes to rebuild lost notes (parity).

---

## 2. **How RAID Works**

* Data is distributed across multiple drives using three techniques:

  1. **Striping** → Splitting data into chunks (faster).
  2. **Mirroring** → Making identical copies (safer).
  3. **Parity** → Extra information used to rebuild lost data.

👉 If one disk fails → RAID can rebuild or continue working (depending on RAID level).

---

## 3. **Types of RAID Levels**

---

### 🔹 **RAID 0 – Striping**

* **Data is split into chunks and stored across multiple disks.**
* No redundancy → If one disk fails, all data is lost.
* Improves **speed**, not safety.

📌 **Example:**
File = “HELLO” →

* Disk 1 = “HE”
* Disk 2 = “LL”
* Disk 3 = “O”

✔️ Advantages:

* High performance (faster read/write).
* Full storage capacity used.

❌ Disadvantages:

* No fault tolerance (if 1 disk fails, everything is gone).

👉 **Use Case:** Gaming PCs, video editing, temporary work storage.

---

Ahh 👍 got it — your PDF actually lists **all RAID levels (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10)**.
Earlier, I explained only the commonly used ones (0, 1, 5, 6, 10). Let me now **cover every RAID level** in detail with working, examples, pros & cons, and real-world use cases.

---

# 💾 RAID Levels (Complete Notes)

---

## 🔹 **RAID 0 (Striping)**

* **Data split across multiple disks** (no redundancy).
* Boosts performance (parallel read/write).
* Minimum Disks: 2
* Fault Tolerance: ❌ None

👉 Example: File “HELLO” →

* Disk 1 = HE
* Disk 2 = LL
* Disk 3 = O

✔️ Fastest reads/writes
❌ If one disk fails → all data lost.

📌 **Use Case:** Gaming PCs, temporary rendering storage.

---

## 🔹 **RAID 1 (Mirroring)**

* **Exact copy** of data stored on two or more disks.
* Minimum Disks: 2
* Fault Tolerance: ✅ Can survive one disk failure.

👉 Example:

* Disk 1 = HELLO
* Disk 2 = HELLO

✔️ High reliability
❌ Expensive (50% storage wasted).

📌 **Use Case:** Banking, medical, critical systems.

---

## 🔹 **RAID 2 (Bit-level Striping with Hamming Code)**

* Data striped at **bit level** (not block/byte).
* Uses **Hamming error correction codes** on extra disks for error detection & correction.
* Minimum Disks: Very high (needs multiple data + ECC disks).

✔️ Provides error correction (not just detection).
❌ Rarely used (modern ECC RAM replaced it).
❌ Complex, inefficient for real use.

📌 **Use Case:** Mostly theoretical; not in modern systems.

---

## 🔹 **RAID 3 (Byte-level Striping with Dedicated Parity)**

* Data striped at **byte level**.
* One dedicated disk holds **parity information**.
* Minimum Disks: 3
* Fault Tolerance: ✅ Can survive one disk failure.

👉 Example:

* Disk 1 = A1, B1
* Disk 2 = A2, B2
* Disk 3 = Parity

✔️ High throughput (good for large sequential files).
❌ If parity disk fails → system vulnerable.

📌 **Use Case:** Media streaming, video production.

---

## 🔹 **RAID 4 (Block-level Striping with Dedicated Parity)**

* Similar to RAID 3 but **data striped in blocks (not bytes)**.
* One disk stores parity.
* Minimum Disks: 3
* Fault Tolerance: ✅ Can survive one disk failure.

✔️ Good random read performance.
❌ Parity disk is a bottleneck (all writes go to same disk).

📌 **Use Case:** Rare today; replaced by RAID 5.

---

## 🔹 **RAID 5 (Block-level Striping with Distributed Parity)**

* Data + parity **distributed across all disks** (no single parity bottleneck).
* Minimum Disks: 3
* Fault Tolerance: ✅ Can survive one disk failure.

👉 Example:

* Disk 1 = Data A1, Data B2, Parity C
* Disk 2 = Data A2, Parity B, Data C1
* Disk 3 = Parity A, Data B1, Data C2

✔️ Balanced (performance + redundancy).
❌ Rebuild after disk failure is slow.

📌 **Use Case:** Web/file servers, small databases.

---

## 🔹 **RAID 6 (Block-level Striping with Double Distributed Parity)**

* Like RAID 5 but **two parity blocks** stored across disks.
* Minimum Disks: 4
* Fault Tolerance: ✅ Can survive **two disk failures**.

✔️ Safer than RAID 5.
❌ Slower writes (extra parity calculation).

📌 **Use Case:** Enterprise servers, mission-critical storage.

---

## 🔹 **RAID 10 (Nested RAID 1 + 0)**

* Combines **RAID 1 (mirroring)** + **RAID 0 (striping)**.
* Data mirrored first, then striped across disks.
* Minimum Disks: 4
* Fault Tolerance: ✅ Can survive multiple failures (depending on disks).

✔️ Best of both: High performance + High reliability.
❌ Expensive (50% storage loss).

📌 **Use Case:** Databases, financial transactions, gaming servers.

✅ **In short**

* RAID 0 → Performance only
* RAID 1 → Reliability only
* RAID 2 → Old, theoretical
* RAID 3 → Byte striping + dedicated parity
* RAID 4 → Block striping + dedicated parity
* RAID 5 → Distributed parity (balanced)
* RAID 6 → Double distributed parity (safer)
* RAID 10 → Best mix (performance + safety)
